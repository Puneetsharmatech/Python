Print function:   Print("hello world");
   in this syntax, value between quotes ("") called string.
   in this print is function. Function is a part of code that used to cause an error or evaluate value. we have python built in function and we can create.

Function Execution in python:

1. Checks function name
2. check arguments passed
3. jumps code into function
4. Execute the function
5. Returns your code 
6. Resume execution 


Print("hello world \n  hello to all world"); 
output: hello world
        hello to world
in this case \n means new line. this prints as a new line


If we pass multiple argument like 
»>> print ("Hello", "future", "Python", "programmer!" )
Hello future Python programmer!
it combine all 


>>>
print ("Hello!", end="");\
print("Python is a great language")
Hello!Python is a great language

in above syntax end="" combine both lines with define string.
>>>
print ("Hello!", end="!");\
print("Python is a great language")
Hello!! Python is a great language
>>> print （"Hello！"， end="
... print("Python is a great language")
Hello!"Python is a great language


Another arguement is sep=""
it will seprate every string with define string, number etc.
>>>
print ("Hello", "future", "Python", "programmer!", sep="-");
Hello-future-Python-programmer !








Literals

A literals is data which values are determined by literals. e:g string "hello world", number 20 etc.
In python we have four types of literals.
1.Integers e:g 1, 345  
1.a octal numbers e:g 0o123 for here base is 8
1.b hexadecimal numbers e:g 0x123 in this base is 16
2.floating point number e:g 45.3, -56.2
3.strings e:g "hello", 'hello'
4.booleans e:g TRUE(1) or FALSE(0)
